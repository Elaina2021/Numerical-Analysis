# Numerical-Analysis
## Codes for Question 1 and 2 are in `Question_1` and `Question_2` respectively
## Multiple Linear Regression method
Just run `Multiple_Linear_Regression.py`.  
You can run `predict.py` to predict the `Marks` by using the MLR method with best parameters. Have fun!  
__Note:__ `MLR_without_squared.py` means there is no square transform on arguments, which leads to a poor result.  
## Neural network method
The remaining files are for neural network method. Since it does not produce a good result, it is just considered as an exciting attempt.  
Run `train.py` to train the network.
